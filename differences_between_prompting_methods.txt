# 🧠 Cognitive Loop Prompts: Recursive Thinking in a Single Prompt

## Overview
This document introduces the concept of the **Cognitive Loop Prompt**, a novel prompting method that enables recursive reasoning in advanced language models using only a **single prompt message**. Unlike conventional prompting methods that rely on multi-step chains, agent scaffolding, or external feedback systems, Cognitive Loop Prompts operate entirely within a single inference window.

This document focuses on how **Cognitive Loop Prompts differ from other prompting paradigms**, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct, AutoGPT, and traditional role-based prompting.

## 🔄 Key Properties of Cognitive Loop Prompts

- **Single-shot recursion**: Entire reasoning cycle is embedded in one prompt.
- **No toolchain dependency**: Works without external memory, agent frameworks, or orchestrators.
- **Self-contained loop**: Prompt includes reflection, iteration, and termination criteria.
- **Model-agnostic**: Applicable to any sufficiently capable LLM.

## 🧭 What Makes It Different?

### 1. **Recursive Thinking Without Multi-Turn Prompts**
Traditional recursive methods require user intervention or controller logic to simulate iteration. Cognitive Loop Prompts embed this logic directly into the prompt, allowing the model to reprocess its output internally.

### 2. **No External Scaffolding Required**
- **AutoGPT**, **LangChain**, and similar frameworks rely on external codebases, memory, and agents to coordinate AI behavior.
- **Cognitive Loop Prompts** work in standalone sessions—no API hooks, no persistent memory, no agents.

### 3. **Behavioral Modulation is Internal, Not Role-Based**
- Role prompting ("Act as a math teacher") provides a **surface-level tone or function**.
- In contrast, a Cognitive Loop Prompt encodes a **cognitive process**, not just a persona—resulting in structured, layered thought.

### 4. **Explicit Loop Logic**
- Chain-of-Thought prompting encourages models to reason step-by-step but lacks iterative self-correction.
- ReAct enables feedback-based interaction with environments, but requires multi-round control.
- Cognitive Loop Prompts embed revision triggers directly in the prompt, enabling:
  - Self-critique
  - Rewriting
  - Stopping conditions

## 📐 Example Prompt
```text
Reflect recursively on the following argument. For each iteration, identify a weakness, suggest a refinement, and reassess. Repeat this loop until no further improvement is possible. 

"Artificial intelligence cannot be trusted to make moral decisions."

Iteration 1:
- Weakness: The statement is overly broad and lacks context. It does not specify what kind of moral decisions or under what conditions.
- Refinement: "Artificial intelligence, lacking human empathy and experiential context, may not be reliable in complex moral decisions."
- Reassessment: This version narrows the concern and highlights the AI's lack of lived experience as the root issue.

Iteration 2:
- Weakness: It assumes that empathy and experience are necessary for all moral decisions, which may not hold for rule-based or utilitarian frameworks.
- Refinement: "Artificial intelligence, while capable of rule-based ethical reasoning, may struggle with context-sensitive or emotionally nuanced moral decisions."
- Reassessment: Now the argument admits that AI has some moral capacity but is limited in scope.

Iteration 3:
- Weakness: It still implies that emotional nuance is essential to all moral contexts, but this may depend on the ethical system being applied.
- Refinement: "Artificial intelligence can simulate certain ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism) but lacks subjective grounding, making it ill-suited for decisions requiring empathy or virtue ethics."
- Reassessment: The argument now distinguishes between types of moral reasoning and acknowledges where AI excels and where it does not.

Final Statement (Iteration 4):
- No major weaknesses remain without expanding into speculative metaphysics or niche edge cases.
- Final Form: "Artificial intelligence can execute certain moral reasoning systems algorithmically but lacks subjective grounding, which limits its trustworthiness in decisions involving empathy, intuition, or human values."

## 🧬 Summary
Cognitive Loop Prompts represent a minimalist yet powerful prompting method that:
- Enables recursive reasoning without chaining
- Operates independently of external tooling
- Encodes a structured cognitive process in a single message
- Differs from role prompting by creating *behavioral* depth, not just tone or style

This method can integrate with larger AI systems via **Shapes, Frameworks, and Geometries**, but it can also operate independently, showcasing its flexibility.
