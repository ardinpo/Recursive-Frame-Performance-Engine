# ðŸ“Ž Shape Persistence and Versioning

## Overview
In the RFPE paradigm, shapes represent reusable cognitive frames. As these shapes evolveâ€”through usage, refinement, or collaborative feedbackâ€”it becomes important to preserve their distinct versions. Shape persistence and versioning introduces a method for treating AI mental states as *modular assets*, similar to code libraries.

## Benefits
- Enables reusability of refined cognitive strategies
- Facilitates collaboration among developers and researchers
- Provides a foundation for benchmarking shape performance over time

## Key Features

### 1. Named Shapes
Each instantiated shape can be named and described, for example:
- `CodeBuilder_v1.2-speed`
- `RefactorArchitect_v2.0-robust`

### 2. Shape Export and Import
Users may export shapes (as metadata structures or prompts) and re-import them later or across sessions, enabling:
- Portability of workflows
- Distribution of best practices

### 3. Version Control Principles
Like code, shapes can follow semantic versioning:
- **Major updates** reflect a shift in methodology or scope
- **Minor updates** reflect refinements or improvements
- **Patch updates** address narrow issues in shape logic or performance

### 4. Shape Logs and Changelogs
For auditing and transparency, RFPE systems may maintain a changelog for each shape:
- What changed?
- Why was the change made?
- What performance differences were observed?

## Future Directions
- GitHub-style repositories for shared shapes
- Community-driven shape libraries with peer review
- Automated benchmarking of shape versions on common tasks

## Conclusion
Shape persistence and versioning allows RFPE-based AI systems to grow *organically and traceably*. By treating internal states as reusable software artifacts, developers and users gain precise control over the evolution of the AIâ€™s problem-solving capabilities.
