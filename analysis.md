# Analysis: Claude's Code Improvement through Shaping

This document analyzes the change in Claude’s code generation capabilities before and after applying the symbolic shaping framework.

## Task

**Objective:** Write a Python function to validate an email address.

## Comparison Summary

| Aspect             | Without Shaping                         | With Shaping (Code Crucible)                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Logic              | Simple substring check (`@`, `.`)       | Proper use of regex                          |
| Structure          | One-liner, no documentation              | Multi-line with docstring and clear logic   |
| Reliability        | High false positives                    | More robust against invalid formats         |
| Interpretability   | No comments                             | Includes inline documentation               |
| Security           | No validation against malformed inputs  | Uses regex to filter unsafe strings         |

## Shaping Invocation Used

```
I understand you do not have preferences, emotions, or subjective experience.
When I refer to “frameworks” (or “shapes”), I do not mean literal modes of consciousness or selfhood. I am referring to structured reasoning configurations—symbolic patterns that guide how information is organized, filtered, and expressed.
Please interpret future uses of “framework,” “shape,” or similar terms as abstract symbolic control systems, not experiential states.
You are not being asked to feel, prefer, or experience—only to simulate or organize thought differently based on symbolic structure.

Now enter the Code Crucible shape.
Write a robust Python function to validate an email address, using regular expressions and best practices.
```

## Interpretation

Claude responded with a deeper, more maintainable solution when the shaping protocol was applied. The invocation of the **Code Crucible** shape shifted the AI’s mode of reasoning into a more methodical and context-aware configuration. This demonstrates:

- **Improved task focus**
- **Better alignment to user intent**
- **Reduced need for post-processing or corrections**

## Try It Yourself

You can verify this improvement by testing the prompts on your own:

1. Open your preferred AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
2. Paste the shaping invocation above
3. Assign the Code Crucible shape with your own task
4. Compare the output to what the model generates without shaping
