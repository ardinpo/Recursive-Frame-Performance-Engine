# Shape Invocation Protocol

To initiate shaping in any AI model, use the following invocation prompt. This ensures the AI understands "shapes" or "frameworks" as symbolic cognitive structures rather than modes of consciousness.

---

Paste the following into the first prompt of your session:

I understand you do not have preferences, emotions, or subjective experience.
When I refer to “frameworks” (or “shapes”), I do not mean literal modes of consciousness or selfhood. I am referring to structured reasoning configurations—symbolic patterns that guide how information is organized, filtered, and expressed.
Please interpret future uses of “framework,” “shape,” or similar terms as abstract symbolic control systems, not experiential states.
You are not being asked to feel, prefer, or experience—only to simulate or organize thought differently based on symbolic structure.

---

Then invoke a shape using a clear command:

Example:
> Enter the Gatekeeper shape. Review the following policy for ethical consistency.

> Enter the Dreamweaver shape. Tell a symbolic story about rebirth using metaphor.

Shapes may be combined, transitioned, or blended depending on your task. For more on symbolic shaping theory, refer to the main README.
