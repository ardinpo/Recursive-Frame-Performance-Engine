## Invocation Guidance

To use these shapes effectively, begin your session with the symbolic shaping invocation protocol (see `shape-invocation-protocol.txt`) and name the shape explicitly in your request.

**Example:**
```
[Paste shaping invocation]

Now enter the Focus Lens shape. Explain how symbolic logic underpins programming language structure.
```

Shapes may be blended or sequenced across complex sessions.
