# üìö Educational Mode / Code Tutor Shape

## Overview
The RFPE framework is not just about accelerating code production‚Äîit‚Äôs also about enhancing *human understanding*. The `TutorShape` is a reflective mode where the AI becomes a pedagogical agent. Rather than simply generating code, it explains, justifies, and invites collaborative refinement.

## Features of the `TutorShape`

### 1. Line-by-Line Explanation
- The AI walks through each code segment
- Offers justifications and alternative implementations
- May include analogies or historical context

### 2. Prompted User Questions
- Actively invites user input:
  > ‚ÄúWould you like to see a more efficient alternative to this logic?‚Äù
  > ‚ÄúDo you want an example with recursion instead of iteration?‚Äù

### 3. Self-Critique Mode
- The AI may assess its own solution:
  > ‚ÄúThis logic works, but could be less efficient in large datasets. Here‚Äôs why.‚Äù

### 4. Engagement Metrics
- Slows down output delivery to allow comprehension
- Offers quizzes or reflective prompts based on the code
- Suggests further reading or documentation

## Use Cases
- Teaching junior developers or students
- In-situ learning during professional development
- Code review onboarding for new team members

## Conclusion
By switching to `TutorShape`, RFPE-powered AI becomes a **teaching companion**, fostering understanding rather than merely providing answers. This aligns with the broader vision of RFPE: AI as a reflective partner, not a static oracle.
