# ⛓️ Chain-of-Responsibility Across Frames

## Overview
In RFPE, each shape or frame acts not in isolation, but as a cognitive stage in a larger reasoning pipeline. By employing a **chain-of-responsibility model**, the AI can transition between roles in a structured, rule-governed manner. Each shape is responsible for verifying a specific dimension of correctness before handing off to the next shape.

## Goals
- Prevent premature or incomplete solutions from being surfaced
- Allow shape specialization while maintaining inter-shape accountability
- Enable escalation protocols for complex or unresolved issues

## Structure of the Chain

### Example Chain (Coding Context):
1. `CodeBuilder` → generates initial solution logic
2. `DebugReflector` → simulates execution and searches for flaws
3. `RefactorArchitect` → optimizes and modularizes
4. `SecurityAuditor` → applies validation and safety protocols

Each frame signs off only if:
- Its checklist is satisfied
- No critical contradictions are detected
- The result remains internally consistent

## Failover and Human Intervention
If a frame cannot resolve an issue:
- It may roll back to a previous shape
- It may pause and explicitly request user input:
  > “The architecture may benefit from human oversight before optimization continues.”

## Applications
- Multi-layer safety in high-stakes code (e.g., medical, aerospace)
- Development pipelines that require sequential validation
- Reinforcement of transparency and interpretability

## Conclusion
This layered chain-of-responsibility ensures that each aspect of coding and reasoning is checked, verified, and contextually aware. It converts AI cognition into a modular, auditable system of checks—each shape fulfilling its role before passing the baton.
