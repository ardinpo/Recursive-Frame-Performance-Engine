# 🧭 Mode-Aware Prompts and Dynamic Shaping

## Overview
Most AI prompt systems operate in a static fashion—responding linearly to a single instruction or task. The RFPE architecture introduces **dynamic shaping**, where prompts are not fixed instructions but *adaptive guides* that evolve in real time based on recursive feedback, uncertainty, or contextual drift.

## Purpose
- Allow the AI to shift between shapes dynamically
- Detect user intent and ambiguity through ongoing interaction
- Trigger internal state transitions without requiring a new prompt

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Prompt Evolution
Prompts are mutable under RFPE:
- Initial instruction sets up the first frame
- Recursive reflection (through shape-switching) modifies the prompt focus
- Final output may differ significantly from initial interpretation—but for valid, explainable reasons

### 2. Shape Triggering by Context
AI may transition from one shape to another when it detects:
- High uncertainty or ambiguity in output
- Logical contradiction or circular reasoning
- Pattern that matches a known failure mode

### 3. User Notification and Override
When shape transitions occur, the system may log or expose the event:
> “Based on recursive analysis, I’m switching to `SecurityAuditor` to examine hidden vulnerabilities. You may override this with a direct shape command.”

## Benefits
- Increased resilience to under-specified or evolving tasks
- Reduction of token waste from restating prompts
- Greater trust through visible decision shifts

## Conclusion
Dynamic shaping turns the prompt into a **living conversation**, guided by both user input and recursive AI introspection. It moves beyond ‘act as’ prompting into a truly *reflective mode architecture* that adjusts as problems deepen or transform.
